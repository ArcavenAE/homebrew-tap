# Updated by .github/workflows/alpha.yml on every push to develop.
# Installs as `sidestep-a` so alpha, rc, and stable coexist
# (forestage-a / jr-a fleet convention). macOS only (arm64).

      Alpha channel: cut from every push to develop. Installs as
      `sidestep-a` and coexists with `sidestep-rc` and `sidestep`.

      Bootstrap a token (recommended — uses macOS Keychain):

        sidestep-a auth login --token <bearer-token>
        sidestep-a auth status
    EOS
  end

  test do
    assert_match "sidestep", shell_output("#{bin}/sidestep-a --version 2>&1")
  end
