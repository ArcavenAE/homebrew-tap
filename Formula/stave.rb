# Homebrew formula for stave
# Single channel, kos pattern: updated by CI on every push to main
# (alpha-... versions) and on v* tags (stable versions). The same
# formula tracks the latest published artifact, alpha or stable.
# macOS only (arm64). Linux support is a future option.

      stave updates on every push to main (alpha versions) until the
      first stable tag is cut.

      Bootstrap credentials (recommended; the client secret goes to the
      macOS Keychain):

        stave auth login
        stave auth status

      Discover and invoke operations:

        stave ops list
        stave api list_issues --var first=5
        stave list issue --limit 5

      stave is read-only against your tenant by default; GraphQL
      mutations require --allow-write.

      Every API call writes a structured JSONL audit line under
      ~/.stave/audit/ (macOS) or ~/.local/state/stave/audit/ (Linux).
